# Dice Game NEA

This is my take on the OCR Dice Game NEA.

## Features
- [x] Authentication
- [x] Tutorial
- [x] Scoring system
- [x] Sound effects and music! Not strictly necessary but fun.

## To Do
- Allow for the creation of new user accounts, the details of which will be stored in an SQL database. This will take a while.
- Store highscores in said SQL database and then display these in a leaderboard format. This will also take a long time.
