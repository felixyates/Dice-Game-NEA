Today, you will compete for the title of dice rolling champion!
You will roll two dice at the start of each round, the total of which will be added to your score.
If the total is even, you'll gain 10 points, but if it's odd, you'll lose 5 points (you won't go below 0, though).
If you score a double, you can roll again, and the value of the dice will be added to your score.
At the end of 5 rounds, if it's a tie, you will roll one dice each until one of you scores more!
On with the game!
